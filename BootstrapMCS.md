Bootstrap Techniques for MCS
==================================

- Bootstrapping can be a very useful tool in statistics and it is very easily implemented in R. 
- Bootstrapping comes in handy when there is doubt that the usual distributional assumptions and asymptotic results are valid and accurate. 
- Bootstrapping is a nonparametric method which lets us compute estimated standard errors, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
