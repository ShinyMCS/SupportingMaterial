The Fisher-Pitman permutation test can detect any type of difference between two samples: 
hence, a significant Fisher-Pitman permutation test does not necessarily provide evidence 
for a difference in means. 

It is possible, however, to test separately for differences in means and variances. 
Here, we present a recently proposed two-stage procedure to decide whether there are
differences in means or variances that can be applied when samples may come 
from nonnormal distributions with possibly unequal variances.
