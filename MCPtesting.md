Multiple Comparison Procedures
====================================
In general, if we perform m hypothesis tests, what is the probability of at least 1 false positive?

- P(Making an error) = α
- P(Not making an error) = 1 - α
- P(Not making an error in m tests) = (1 - α)m
- P(Making at least 1 error in m tests) = 1 - (1 - α)m
